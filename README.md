# Introduction:

The United States is one of the most developed and prosperous countries in the world, but crime remains a persistent problem. In 1973,
statistics were collected on arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states. Additionally,
data was collected on the percent of the population living in urban areas. 
This dataset provides valuable information on the crime situation in the US and can help guide policymakers in their efforts to reduce crime and improve public safety.
In this report, we will perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data, and then use two different clustering techniques to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between different variables and to find any common factors that may be contributing to high crime rates in certain areas.
