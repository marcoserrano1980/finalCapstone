# Introduction:
#
# The United States is one of the most developed and prosperous countries in the world, but crime remains a persistent problem. In 1973,
# statistics were collected on arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states. Additionally,
# data was collected on the percent of the population living in urban areas. 
# This dataset provides valuable information on the crime situation in the US and can help guide policymakers in their efforts to reduce crime and improve public safety.
# In this report, we will perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data, and then use two different clustering techniques to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
# The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between different variables and to find any common factors that may be contributing to high crime rates in certain areas.


# Installation:
#
# Here are the steps to install the project locally:
#
# Install the necessary libraries: 
# To run the project, you'll need to have the latest version of pandas and any other libraries specified in the code installed in your local environment.
# You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
# pip install pandas
#
# Use the project files:
#	. UsArrests.csv
#       . task_1.ipynb
#
# Run the code: 
# To run the code, open the project folder in your local environment and open the script that contains the code in a Python editor.
# Then, run the code by clicking on the "Run" button or by using the command line/terminal and navigating to the directory where the script is located and running the command python scriptname.py


# View the results: 
# The results of the analysis will be displayed in your within the output cells of your Jupyter Notebook


# Note: 
# Make sure you have a working Python environment with the necessary libraries installed before running the code


# Usage
# Running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: 
#	jupyter notebook. This will open a web browser window where you can manage task_1.ipynb
